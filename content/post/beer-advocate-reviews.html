<p>Interviewing for data science jobs is hard. Since the job definition and responsibilities vary significantly between companies and roles, you never quite know what areas of the field you’ll be asked about during an interview. This is stressful for the interviewee and can result in misleading results for the interviewer.</p>
<p>A while back I stumbled on a great <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-hire-test-data-skills-one-size-fits-all-interview-tanya-cashorali/">blog post</a> by Tanya Cashorali where she goes into detail about why she’s taken to using a take-home ‘test’ to evaluate potential data scientists. She even lays out a test dataset and problems for interviews.</p>
<p>I loved her take on how bad many data science interviews are and I thought it would be great practice(and maybe useful for anyone who stumbles upon this post!) to work through the test she lays out. The test she proposes is simple, but can be answered on a variety of levels depending on the candidates experience. Using a dataset from the popular beer(yay beer!) review website Beer Advocate, you need to answer four analytics questions and communicate your findings:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Which brewery produces the strongest beers by ABV?</li>
<li>If you had to pick 3 beers to recommend using only this data, which would you pick?</li>
<li>Which of the factors(aroma, taste, appearance, palette) are most important in determining the overall quality of a beer?</li>
<li>If I typically enjoy a beer due to its aroma and appearance, which beer style should I try?</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a really exciting dataset as a beer lover, so without further ado, let’s dive in!<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<div id="data-exploration" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Exploration</h2>
<p>I always need to get a feel for the dataset before doing any sort of analysis. With 1,586,614 reviews, the dataset is large enough that I can’t just glance at it and understand it, but small enough that I don’t have to worry about using fancy techniques to speed things up–just load the data into R and start exploring!</p>
<p>First, I’d like to know a bit about who’s represented in the dataset. There are 5,840 distinct breweries and 66,055 distinct beers represented. The breweries with the most reviews are pretty familiar–Sam Adams, Sierra Nevada, Dogfish, Bells– but where are the ‘macro’ breweries? It seems that the beer advocate dataset is a picture of the craft brew beer scene and won’t necessarily be representative of all beer drinkers. I guess you have to be pretty ‘in’ to beer to post reviews online and find your way into this dataset. The big 3 American macro-breweries (Anheuser, Millers and Coors) <em>are</em> present in the data<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, but not sitting at the top with the most reviews like you might expect from the breweries that sell the most beer by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/garystoller/2018/03/20/craft-breweries-dominate-the-top-50-but-guess-which-giants-rule-the-beer-market/#3c5064e6dcad">volume</a>. This isn’t particularly important for the questions being asked here, but it’s good to identify biases in your dataset as you recognize them–this dataset is <em>definitely</em> not representitive of the beer drinking population as a whole!</p>

<p>Second, I want to know how many reviews beers typically get. If I’m going to recommend beers, it’s probably not a great idea to recommend a beer that’s only been reviewed 1 time–even if it got a perfect review. Similarly, saying a brewery produces the strongest beers by ABV probably means two different things if one brewery makes 15 different beers while the other only makes 1. This gets to the issue of thresholding–at what level do I need to exclude reviews/beers/breweries for not having enough data to give a reasonable answer?</p>

<p>It turns out that most beers get <em>very</em> few reviews. Median reviews for a beer is just 2, but the mean, 24, is heavily pushed to the right by the very popular beers in the right tail of the distribution.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-many-beers-do-breweries-produce" class="section level3">
<h3>How Many Beers do Breweries Produce?</h3>
<p>It’s also going to be helpful to know how many distinct beers a typical brewery produces.</p>
<p><img src="/post/beer-advocate-reviews_files/figure-html/beer-produced-by-breweries-1.png" width="90%" height="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Using very similar <a href="https://gist.github.com/Grollus/c6c911b5bf3ddb9c0178f9265a81e42f">code</a> to that used above, I can see that 20.2% of breweries only make one beer! The mean number of beers a brewery produces is just 9 with a median of 4. So for the most part, breweries aren’t producing(or at least people aren’t reviewing) <em>that</em> many different beers. This will need to be dealt with when deciding how many beers is ‘enough’ to include a brewery in the highest ABV brewery question.</p>

<h3>Does the Style of Beer Matter? You Bet it Does!</h3>
<p>As a final exploratory question, I want to examine how the different styles of beer fare. Are some considerably more popular? Are some just better? Are some styles really consistent–ie you see very little variance in how it’s rated? I really have no idea, but knowing a bit more about beer styles will be helpful when recommending a beer style in question four.</p>
<p>First, there are 104 different styles of beer represented in the dataset. As you can see, several styles are <strong>really</strong> popular, while others are quite uncommon.</p>

<p>I think it could be useful to know how beer style and overall review score interact. Knowing a little bit about beer, I could see a situation where one style–let’s say Quadrupels(Quads)–are always highly rated, but another–maybe American Lagers–are generally rated very low. Just knowing the style of a beer might give us a lot of information about how that beer is going to be reviewed.</p>
<p>Looking at the top 5 and bottom 5 scoring styles, it’s pretty shocking how different their average scores are. Is it really that difficult to make a delicious Light Lager? Or on the flip side, are Quads that easy to make–or do humans just love the taste of them? Who knows, but I know I want to dive a tiny bit deeper to see how much variance there is in the reviews of each style of beer. Maybe it’s possible to get a good Light Lager, but there are a host of bad ones out there dragging down the average score. Also, remember what we discovered above– this dataset isn’t at all representative of the general beer drinking population. If we had reviews from that population, I suspect the average scores of beer styles would look very different.</p>

<div id="overall-review-scores-for-different-beer-styles-how-much-do-they-vary" class="section level3">
<h3>Overall review scores for different beer styles: How much do they vary?</h3>
<p>I can generate confidence intervals to see how much variance there is in the scores of different styles of beer. There are a couple different ways to approach this–mainly related to how you decide to group–and each have their advantages so I include both here.</p>
<div id="filter-then-filter-again-styles-that-have-30-different-beers-that-had-at-least-30-reviews" class="section level4">
<h4>Filter, then filter again! Styles that have 30 different beers that had at least 30 reviews</h4>
<p>The first approach groups by unique beers and then style. So, for example, beer 1904 is an American IPA that has 3000 reviews and an average score of ~4.17. Once I have this information, I can generate confidence intervals, but I need to deal with the tricky question of what beers to include in the calculations. If a beer is only reviewed 1 time, should it be included? What about if a beer style only has 15 different beers to it’s name? In order to get a good estimation of both the point estimate and the confidence intervals, I need to have enough data about each beer, otherwise it could be that only one person reviewed a beer and they just had a terrible day and unjustly gave it 1 star–and then are skewing our analysis here.</p>
<p>It’s definitely a judgement call how to filter here, but I want to feel confident my intervals are meaningful. I’m only keeping beers that have &gt;= 30 reviews(about 7100), then I count how many beers of each style remain and I’m filtering again to keep only those styles with at least 30 beers–so each style that remains has at least 30 different beers that had at least 30 reviews.</p>

<p>The top styles here don’t surprise me, but it’s very interesting to see which styles are more variable than others. If you were to pick a random Imperial Stout/Barleywine/American IPA, you could be pretty confident you know exactly how good of a beer you are going to get. But if you pick something like a Gueuze or Old Ale, there’s a bit more variation in how ‘good’ the beer is–it could be the best beer you’ve ever had or it could be OK.</p>
<p>The bottom portion of the style list is interesting not for the styles on it, but for the little bit of extra variance. Many of these styles have confidence intervals .2-.3 points wide, whereas the top styles were rarely over .1 points wide. Euro Dark Lager, for example, have a 95% confidence interval from 3.34 - 3.63. To me, this means that Euro Dark Lagers aren’t inherently bad beers, but when you order one you aren’t really sure if you are getting a good beer or one not worth drinking. Simply put, there’s a little more variance in the reviews of that style of beer.</p>
</div>
<div id="keep-all-the-beerswithin-reason" class="section level4">
<h4>Keep all the beers–within reason!</h4>
<p>The filtering approach above has a clear bias. Only beers–and beer styles– that are popular are included in the final results. There are good reasons for filtering out those beers, but we definitely lose a lot of beers in the process–some 59,272. Another approach that doesn’t remove so many beers is to stop filtering out individual beers with very few reviews and instead to treat beers as members of a beer style family. So instead of removing all those beers with, say, 1 or 2 reviews, I say ‘This Pale Ale only has 1 review, but it’s still a Pale Ale, so let’s treat it like one’. I still do a quick filter to make sure no style has fewer than 30 reviews(spoiler: none do!) and then plot the results with confidence intervals.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># This approach creates a unique id for each review(since there isn&#39;t one in the dataset)
# and then it groups by beer style. This means I keep all individual reviews, but those

<p><img src="/post/beer-advocate-reviews_files/figure-html/non-filtered-styles-conf-ints-1.png" width="90%" height="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> The results are pretty similar to the other approach with some small differences. First, the confidence intervals are narrower for all styles. This is expected because of how I did the grouping. Instead of having, say, 100 beers to base the estimates off of, these styles may use thousands of reviews–remember all those one review beers we filtered out before? With all that additional data, the confidence intervals <em>should</em> get narrower. Second, we see a handful of new styles present in the top and bottom styles. Lambic - Unblended and Gose didn’t make the cut before, but are present now. These new additions to the to and bottom styles have the wider confidence intervals because they are basing the estimates of less data.</p>
<p>Essentially though, the information present is the same. Reviewers love stouts, belgian ales, sours and IPAs and they tend to dislike lagers and light beers.</p>

<h2>Which brewery produces the strongest beers by ABV%?</h2>
With a better handle on the dataset, now I can actually address the question! First things first, there are 67,785 reviews with no ABV data so we need to remove that data. It’s only 4.27% of all reviews, so for the time being I’m not going to worry about just removing those reviews. Now the question is–what <em>is</em> a strong beer anyway? You can see from the histogram of the distribution of ABV’s that the vast majority of beers are under 10% ABV. Only 18 beers out of over 66,000! are over 20% ABV. <img src="/post/beer-advocate-reviews_files/figure-html/beer-abv-exploration-1.png" width="90%" height="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

<p>If I divide the data into reviews of beers &gt; 20% ABV and those &lt; 20% ABV, it’s easier to see how uncommon reviews for really high ABV beers are.</p>
<p><img src="/post/beer-advocate-reviews_files/figure-html/greater-20-abv-distribution-1.png" width="90%" height="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The vast majority of beers reviewed fall right around the 5-6% range.</p>

<p>The question of which brewery produces the strongest beers by ABV has more nuance than it might appear. First, the question asks which brewery produces the strongest <strong>beers</strong> which I am taking to mean it needs to produce more than one beer. Second, how should I measure how strong a breweries beers are? An average of their ABVs? Maybe take the median? What about looking at the proportion of beers that a brewery produces that are above some ‘strong’ beer threshold? All these methods seem to have merit and are pretty simple and quick to perform. Let’s try them out and see what they tell us.</p>
<p>After a bit of filtering, grouping and aggregation(which you can see in the code fold below), you can see that Schorschbräu ranks at the top of both the mean and median rankings. In fact, the top 4 on both graphs are the same–albeit with one positional swap. One note: Why did I only include breweries that make 4 or more beers? Because the median number of beers produced is 4 and that seemed reasonable.</p>

<p>Now what if the brewery that produces the strongest beers is the one that has the highest proportion of its beers above some ABV threshold. We know the mean ABV for a beer is 6.27% (median 5.7%). In fact, the 75th percentile for beer ABV is only 7.2%. 10% is where I, personally, start to think a beer is strong and with only 6.51% of beers having greater than or equal to 10% ABV, I think it’s a pretty reasonable mark of a ‘strong’ beer.</p>
<p><img src="/post/beer-advocate-reviews_files/figure-html/strongest-beer-by-proportion-above-10-1.png" width="90%" height="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Yet again, Schorschbräu sits at the top. They only make 10 different beers, but 90% of them are 10% ABV or higher! For a brewery that produces quite a few more beers, but still cranks out high ABV stuff, AleSmith Brewing Company is up there. They make over 50 different beers and over 70% of them are above 10% ABV.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Shorschbrau brewery seems to sit at the top of the ‘strong’ beer mountain–regardless of the metric I used. With a little googling, it seems they are well known for pushing the limits of strong beers. They even produce one that is 57% ABV!</p>

<h2>If you had to pick 3 beers to recommend using only this data, which would you pick?</h2>
<p>Yet again, there are several ways you could approach this question. People seem to have beer style preferences, so maybe recommending 3 beers based on what style beer you like would perform well–you like Hefeweizens, here are 3 Hefeweizens that you might like. I think this approach probably works OK, but it’s just recommending the top rated beers of each style to you. It’s possible to get more personalized recommendations by building a recommender system. I’m not sure I’d take this approach if I had a strict time limit for this take home test, but since I’m blogging about the process, I’m taking the fun approach and build a recommender system.</p>
<p>So what is a recommender system anyway? If you’ve ever used Netflix or Amazon you’ve encountered them many, many times. A recommendation system takes past user information–in our case beer ratings–to generate predictions for how that user would rate a beer they haven’t tried. There are many ways to do this nowadays, but an extremely popular(and good) method is called matrix factorization. If you want a detailed explanation of the math, check out this great <a href="http://www.albertauyeung.com/post/python-matrix-factorization/">blog post</a>, but the intuition is relatively easy to grasp. First, you build a matrix with users(reviewers in this case) as the rows and items(beers) as the columns. Each cell is the rating that reviewer1 gave beer1, for example. When you flesh out this matrix, there will be empty cells where a reviewer hasn’t tried beer21 or beer143. With matrix factorization we predict what we think the value of these empty cells should be–what would this user rate that beer if they try it? So by predicting the value of these empty cells, the recommendation system is giving us just what we need to recommend new beers to people. What beers should you try? The ones with the highest predicted rating that you haven’t tried yet?</p>
<p>It certainly seems pretty hand-wavy to say we just fill in some cells and use those values to recommend beers. How do you actually generate the predictions you might wonder? We do this by discovering the <em>latent features</em> that determine how a user rates items. The whole concept of matrix factorization works because we can take advantage of the fact that individuals don’t have 100% unique preferences. Our preferences are clustered. Maybe we like movies with a certain actress. Maybe we like a certain genre of movie. Or perhaps we like clothing from a certain designer or with a certain color palette. With beer, maybe we like beers of a certain style or beers that are extra hoppy. These are all things that could be latent features in a recommendation system. Using these latent features we can infer that if user1 and user2 both have a feature ‘Likes movies with Tom Hanks’, then a new movie with Tom Hanks will have a high predicted value for them.</p>
<p>The details of how you solve for these latent features algorithmically can be found in the blog post I linked above(spoiler: you use gradient descent to solve for a user association matrix <strong>P</strong> and an item association matrix <strong>Q</strong>). For our purposes, it’s enough to think we are generating features of reviewers–reviewers that like bitter beers, reviewers that like chocolate stouts, reviewer that like beers from a certain area or of a certain ABV–and generating features for beers–beers that are high ABV, beers that are fruity or bitter, beers from a specific brewery–and using those to construct predictions for unseen beers.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are several great packages in R that allow for easy implementation of matrix factorization. First, I need to do a bit of cleanup. Most reviewers don’t review many beers and most beers don’t get reviewed many times. We like a sparse matrix, but we don’t gain a lot of information from reviewers that review one time or beers than are only reviewed one time. We need to only include reviewers and beers above some threshold.</p>
<p><img src="/post/beer-advocate-reviews_files/figure-html/number-of-reviews-histogram-1.png" width="90%" height="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>I’m filtering the dataset to only include reviewers who have reviewed at least 50 beers and only include beers with at least 100 reviews. With this dataset, I assign new indexes for user_id and beer_id (starting at 1) and then build a sparse triplet matrix–that’s just a fancy way of saying I build a matrix where I only include user and beer combinations that actually have a rating and I make sure it’s of the form (user_id, beer_id, rating).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># filter to reviewers who have reviewed above 50 beers and beers with greater than 100 reviews
over_50_reviews &lt;- reviews_raw%&gt;%
  add_count(review_profilename)%&gt;%
  filter(n &gt;= 50)%&gt;%
  add_count(beer_beerid)%&gt;%
  rename(num_reviews = n)%&gt;%
  filter(num_reviews &gt;=100, 
         !is.na(beer_name),
         !is.na(review_profilename),
         !is.na(review_overall))%&gt;%
  # add new user_id(starting at 1) and beer_id(starting at 1): needed for recosystem triplet matrix
  mutate(., user_id = group_indices(., review_profilename),
         beer_id = group_indices(., beer_beerid))


# recosystem requires a triplet matrix of the form (user, beer, rating)
user_beer_triplet &lt;- over_50_reviews %&gt;%
  select(user_id, beer_id, review_overall)</code></pre>
<p>To train the actual model I need to specify the inputs for the training function and then set the parameters. The main parameter to focus on is <em>dim</em>. This determines the number of latent factors to fit. In playing around, I found that the default of 10 was too few factors. It gave reasonable recommendations, but it was essentially recommending the same beers to everyone, regardless of personal preferences. After a bit of tinkering, I decided to use 200 and see how specific the recommendations would get. You could probably go higher, but the model takes longer to fit and the results were pretty good at 200 already. The code for training and generating predictions for the recommender is in the code chunk below and I’d encourage you do check it out–even though it’s basically straight from the recosystem documentation.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(recosystem)
#create recosystem object
r &lt;- Reco()

# training set is the set of items that actually were rated. In a more advanced system I&#39;d have a separate train/test split for
# the training of the model
# data_memory specifics the inputs to the $train and $predict functions
train_set = data_memory(user_index = user_beer_triplet$user_id,
                        item_index = user_beer_triplet$beer_id,
                        rating = user_beer_triplet$review_overall,
                        index1 = TRUE)

# dim parameter controls the number of latent factors in the model.
# Default dim = 10 and that&#39;s too few--you end up having pretty much
# the same beers recommended to everyone. There is a balancing to be done here
# of creating too many latent factors and essentially overfitting and too few
# and giving really generic recommendations
r$train(train_set, opts = list(dim = 200,                        
                               costp_l1 = 0, costp_l2 = 0.01,   
                               costq_l1 = 0, costq_l2 = 0.01,   
                               niter = 20,                      
                               nthread = 6))

saveRDS(pred, &quot;beer_reco_predictions.RDS&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The model runs through 20 iterations and the RMSE is still dropping. You can really easily overfit this model. If you do 300 or even 400 latent factors the RMSE will continue to drop. In a full scale implementation, I would be using a training and testing set and/or cross validation to choose the number of latent factors that minimizes the RMSE on the test set. Here, I’m simply doing a proof of concept, so we are playing it a bit fast and loose.</p>
<p>With the model trained and predictions precomputed for all users, I can select some users and examine the results. I built a couple helper functions to view the results. The first takes the prediction data frame and filters out the beers that user already reviewed then returns the top 3 beers predicted for them.

<p>Looking at the predictions for two random reviewers in the dataset, you can see that, as expected, they are given different recommendations. User 3831 is recommended an English Bitter, a Red Ale and a Rye which seems to make sense since they have a Rye and a couple Red Ales in their highest rated beers.</p>

<p>User 270 was recommended an Imperial IPA, a Wild Ale and a Hefeweizen. This again makes since as you can see they rate <em>many</em> Imperial IPA’s highly. The recommender is also picking up that user 270 seems to like fruit forward beers–the Wild Ale and the Wisconsin Belgian Red are both fruit forward. It might even be picking up on the fact that beer drinkers who like Witbier’s and Wheat Ale’s tend to like Hefeweizens. It’s pretty remarkable what a well tuned recommender system can predict and even the simple one here seems to do a pretty good job of generating reasonable recommendations for the top 3 beers for a particular reviewer.</p>

<h2>Which of the factors(aroma, taste, appearance, palette) are most important in determining the overall quality of the beer?</h2>
<p>This is another fun question because–yet again–there are a lot of different ways you could reason about finding an answer. Initially, I wanted to use PCA. I figured I could use it to see which factor most closely corresponded to the first principle component–which is where, by definition, most of the variance occurs. But after thinking it over some more, I decided not to use this approach. Typically PCA is used when you have a lot of variables that are in play. Here, I’m only really looking at 4. While I think you could cast the problem in a way to ‘use’ PCA, I don’t know that it’s the good approach, so I’m using other techniques here. I’d love to see how someone would approach this problem using PCA though, so if you get a hankering to do that, please shoot me a link to your analysis in the comments!</p>
<p>Instead of PCA, I’m going to do two things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Examine the correlations between the subfactors(taste, palette, aroma, appearance) and the overall review scores</li>
<li>Fit a linear model and see which factors are most important to the model.</li>

<p>The highest correlations appear between taste and overall and palate and overall. Intuitively this makes sense–how a beer tastes probably plays a pretty big role in how the beer is scored overall. Aroma and appearance are relatively unimportant it seems, but it’s important to note that aroma is highly correlated with taste–after all, smell plays a huge role in how we perceive food–so aroma may be undervalued by this metric.</p>
<p>This scatterplot shows the relationship of appearance/taste/etc to overall scores. You can see how taste is much more tightly clustered(thus the higher correlation), while the others are quite a bit more spread out.</p>

<p>This linear model is predicting review_overall from the sub-reviews–taste, aroma, appearance and palate. With an R-squared of just .658, this model isn’t super accurate, but it’s good enough for our purposes.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> I just want to see which factor is most important to the overall review score after all. It’s tempting to just look at the coefficient values and say whichever is larger is more important, but that’s <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/202846">not really true</a>. Variables on different scales, variables with wildly different variances or multi-collinearity between variables will all make determining feature importance from the coefficient values problematic(if not outright wrong).</p>
<p>Luckily, some very smart statisticians built a package called <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/relaimpo/relaimpo.pdf"><strong>relaimpo</strong></a> that will calculate more useful feature importance metrics. It turns out this is a really slippery and complicated area of statistics, so I’d encourage you to read about it <a href="https://prof.beuth-hochschule.de/fileadmin/prof/groemp/downloads/amstat07mayp139.pdf">here</a> if you’d like to see how a statistician thinks about this area. There are 8 different metrics you can use in <em>relaimpo</em>, but they all basically give the same answer. I’ve included 5 below(<em>lmg</em> and <em>betasq</em> seem to be the most commonly used metrics) and you can see that each metric under ‘Relative importance metrics’ gives the same breakdown of feature importance:</p>

<p>There is quite a bit of difference in how <em>much</em> more important taste is compared to appearance, but the ranking is the same regardless of the metric used–<strong>taste</strong> is most important in determining the overall review of a beer and appearance is least important.</p>

<h2>If I enjoy a beer due to its aroma and appearance, which beer style should I try?</h2>
<p>So what if we aren’t the typical beer drinker and what we really care about is the aroma and appearance of a beer. How should I determine what to drink then? I think a simple approach is appropriate for this question. If a beer drinker has a strong preference for beers that are very aromatic and richly colored, then they should like beer styles that score highly in the review_aroma and review_appearance variables.</p>
<p>For the graph below I grouped by the style of beer and then averaged the aroma and appearance scores. Additionally, I took the average of the aroma and appearance to get a sense of the total ‘smell and sight’ score.</p>

<p>As a beer lover, this plot doesn’t surprise me much. Imperial Stouts are known for being highly aromatic and have a beautiful chocolate/ruby color that reviewers seem to like. If I’m just recommending one style, it’s probably be the <strong>American Double/Imperial Stout</strong> because it has high aroma and appearance scores, while the Russian Imperial Stout has the highest appearance score, but a slightly lower aroma score.</p>
<p>This graphic could also be useful if you care slightly more about, say, the aroma of a beer. You’d just try the styles with the aroma dots on the right side of the dumbbell plot – Quads, Imperial IPAs, Gueuzes, Wild Ales, or Eisbocks perhaps.</p>

<h3>Wrapup</h3>
<p>This was a really fun dataset to play around with, and I have to say I completely agree with Tanya Cashorali when she says this sort of take home test is a great way to interview data science job candidates. There’s a lot of flexibility in how you perform the analysis and I think you get a good idea of what someone is capable of and how they reason about solving actual problems.</p>
