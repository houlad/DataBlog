Hi! I'm just a guy trying to solve problems and answer questions using data. Some people call that a data scientist.
I'm primarily interested in data visualization, NLP, machine learning, education, energy and healthcare. I'll probably write about that stuff,
but I'll probably write about lots of other stuff too.

In my free time you can find me running. Or hiking. Or maybe just reading outside.  If I'm not there, I'm probably roasting coffee. Delicious coffee.

If you find any of this interesting(or wrong) and would like to contact me, you can do so through [twitter](https://twitter.com/Adam_Houl) or [email](mailto:athoul01@gmail.com).

Currently, I'm looking for a data science position. Here's my [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0jvfssx99mzveho/Resume.pdf?dl=0) if you
or anyone you might know are interested.
